* Introduction
+ *Extensible*
  - API is first-class: discoverable, versioned, documented.
  - MessagePack structured communication enables extensions in any language.
  - Remote plugins run as co-processes, safely and asynchronously.
  - GUIs, IDEs, web browsers can --embed Neovim as an editor or script host.

+ *Usable*
  - Strong defaults
  - Works the same everywhere: one build-type, one command
  - Modern terminal features such as cursor styling, focus events, bracketed paste
  - Built-in terminal emulator

+ *Drop-in Vim*
  - Fully compatible with Vim's editing model and the Vimscript language.
  - Start with :help nvim-from-vim if you already use Vim.

* Nvim Configuration
My Neovim project is based on [[https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch][LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch]] by Christian Chiarulli. His YouTube series is perfect! If you start with neovim and lua, it is best start point.

Project is inherited, but not depended. I will synch it time to time. But it is independent now.

Additional features are:
+ Addition of 20+ colorthemes primary for nvim, but some of them are vim. There are included all best themes. These themes can be changes dynamically with external script [[https://github.com/raven2cz/global-colorscheme][global-colorscheme]].
+ Minimap plugin https://github.com/wfxr/minimap.vim
+ Colorizer plugin https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua
