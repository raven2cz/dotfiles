# Terminal hints can be used to find text in the visible part of the terminal

#hints:
  # Keys used for the hint labels.
  #alphabet: "jfkdls;ahgurieowpq"

  # List with all available hints
    #
  # Each hint must have a `regex` and either an `action` or a `command` field.
  # The fields `mouse`, `binding` and `post_processing` are optional.
    #
  # The fields `command`, `binding.key`, `binding.mods`, `binding.mode` and
  # `mouse.mods` accept the same values as they do in the `key_bindings` section.
    #
  # The `mouse.enabled` field controls if the hint should be underlined while
  # the mouse with all `mouse.mods` keys held or the vi mode cursor is above it.
  #
  # If the `post_processing` field is set to `true`, heuristics will be used to
  # shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint
  # (e.g. a trailing `.`). This is most useful for URIs.
  #
  # Values for `action`:
  #   - Copy
  #       Copy the hint's text to the clipboard.
  #   - Paste
  #       Paste the hint's text to the terminal or search.
  #   - Select
  #       Select the hint's text.
  #   - MoveViModeCursor
  #       Move the vi mode cursor to the beginning of the hint.

# Mouse bindings
#
# Mouse bindings are specified as a list of objects, much like the key
# bindings further below.
#
# To trigger mouse bindings when an application running within Alacritty
# captures the mouse, the `Shift` modifier is automatically added as a
# requirement.
#
# Each mouse binding will specify a:
#
# - `mouse`:
#
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# - `action` (see key bindings for actions not exclusive to mouse mode)
#
# - Mouse exclusive actions:
#
#   - ExpandSelection
#       Expand the selection to the current mouse cursor location.
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods` (see key bindings)
#mouse_bindings:
#  - { mouse: Right,                 action: ExpandSelection }
#  - { mouse: Right,  mods: Control, action: ExpandSelection }
#  - { mouse: Middle, mode: ~Vi,     action: PasteSelection  }

# Key bindings
#
# Key bindings are specified as a list of objects. For example, this is the
# default paste binding:
#
# `- { key: V, mods: Control|Shift, action: Paste }`
#
# Each key binding will specify a:
#
# - `key`: Identifier of the key pressed
#
#    - A-Z
#    - F1-F24
#    - Key0-Key9
#
#    A full list with available key codes can be found here:
#    https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/event/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#
#    Instead of using the name of the keys, the `key` field also supports using
#    the scancode of the desired key. Scancodes have to be specified as a
#    decimal number. This command will allow you to display the hex scancodes
#    for certain keys:
#
#       `showkey --scancodes`.
#
# Then exactly one of:
#
# - `chars`: Send a byte sequence to the running application
#
#    The `chars` field writes the specified string to the terminal. This makes
#    it possible to pass escape sequences. To find escape codes for bindings
#    like `PageUp` (`"\x1b[5~"`), you can run the command `showkey -a` outside
#    of tmux. Note that applications use terminfo to map escape sequences back
#    to keys. It is therefore required to update the terminfo when changing an
#    escape sequence.
#
# - `action`: Execute a predefined action
#
#   - ToggleViMode
#   - SearchForward
#       Start searching toward the right of the search origin.
#   - SearchBackward
#       Start searching toward the left of the search origin.

#   - Last
#       Last column, or beginning of the line when already at the last column.
#   - FirstOccupied
#       First non-empty cell in this terminal row, or first non-empty cell of
#       the line when already at the first cell of the row.
#   - High
#       Top of the screen.
#   - Middle
#       Center of the screen.
#   - Low
#       Bottom of the screen.
#   - SemanticLeft
#       Start of the previous semantically separated word.
#   - SemanticRight
#       Start of the next semantically separated word.
#   - SemanticLeftEnd
#       End of the previous semantically separated word.
#   - SemanticRightEnd
#       End of the next semantically separated word.

#
# - macOS exclusive actions:

#       Enter fullscreen without occupying another space.
#
# - Linux/BSD exclusive actions:
#
#   - CopySelection
#       Copy from the selection buffer.
#   - PasteSelection
#       Paste from the selection buffer.
#
# - `command`: Fork and execute a specified command plus arguments
#
#    The `command` field must be a map containing a `program` string and an
#    `args` array of command line parameter strings. For example:
#       `{ program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] }`
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods`: Key modifiers to filter binding actions
#
#    - Command
#    - Control
#    - Option
#    - Super
#    - Shift
#    - Alt
#
#    Multiple `mods` can be combined using `|` like this:
#       `mods: Control|Shift`.
#    Whitespace and capitalization are relevant and must match the example.
#
# - `mode`: Indicate a binding for only specific terminal reported modes
#
#    This is mainly used to send applications the correct escape sequences
#    when in different modes.
#
#    - AppCursor
#    - AppKeypad
#    - Search
#    - Alt
#    - Vi
#
#    A `~` operator can be used before a mode to apply the binding whenever
#    the mode is *not* active, e.g. `~Alt`.
#
# Bindings are always filled by default, but will be replaced when a new
# binding with the same triggers is defined. To unset a default binding, it can
# be mapped to the `ReceiveChar` action. Alternatively, you can use `None` for
# a no-op if you do not wish to receive input characters for that binding.
