Welcome to my AwesomeWM configuration files! My system is managed by Git Subtrees; this github repository is git subtree which is mapped to the [[https://github.com/raven2cz/dotfiles][raven2cz/dotfiles]] project.

AwesomeWM is a highly configurable by LUA, next generation framework window manager for X. It is very fast, extensible and licensed under the ~GNU GPLv2~ license.

It is primarily targeted at power users, developers and any people dealing with every day computing tasks and who wants to have fine-grained control on their graphical environment.
