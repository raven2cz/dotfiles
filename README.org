* Introduction
Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager written and configured in Python.

** Benefits of using a tiling window manager
+ *Optimize your workflow* by configuring your environment to fit how you work.

+ *Efficiently use screen real-estate* by automatically arranging windows with minimal visual cruft.

+ *Save your wrists from RSI* by ditching the mouse and driving with the keyboard.

** Why Qtile?

+ *The Qtile community is active and growing.* There's always someone to lend a hand when you need help.

+ *Qtile is free and open-source software.* Distributed under the permissive *MIT license*.


* Qtile Configuration Documentation and Inheritance
[[https://docs.qtile.org/en/latest/manual/config/index.html][Qtile Official Documentation]] is very good start for a ricing. My configuration is inherited from the *Arco Linux* default configuration. The attached license are included in the main configuration file ~config.py~.

The configuration files are added in ~LICENSE~ (Antonin Fischer (raven2cz) repository), other licenses are included directly in ~config.py~.
