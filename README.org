* Introduction
Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.

* Xfce4 Configuration and Installation Process
This project includes basement configuration of xfce4, which has to be placed to the ~$HOME/.config/xfce4~. The XFCE is whole DE (Desktop Environment); it means that there is much more necessary additional configuration in other directories; themes, icons, gtk3 css settings, applications styles etc. Additional configuration is attached in *my union github project* ~raven2cz/dotfiles~; link [[https://github.com/raven2cz/dotfiles][dotfiles-github]].
