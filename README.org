Welcome to my AwesomeWM configuration files! My system is managed by Git Subtrees; this github repository is git subtree which is mapped to the [[https://github.com/raven2cz/dotfiles][raven2cz/dotfiles]] project.

AwesomeWM is a highly configurable by LUA, next generation framework window manager for X. It is very fast, extensible and licensed under the ~GNU GPLv2~ license.

It is primarily targeted at power users, developers and any people dealing with every day computing tasks and who wants to have fine-grained control on their graphical environment.

* AwesomeWM Themes Configuration
AwesomeWM [git-master] configuration with new *Multicolor Theme*, *80s DarkOne Theme* and *Amazing Theme*.

** Multicolor Theme
The multicolor theme brings 15 best colorschemes today! 13 dark and soft, 2 light themes. You can find here nord, doom_one, tomorrow_night, palenight, dracula, dark one etc. The system binds together special lua script which change the additional applications together: kitty, alacritty (and planned next). In the public-wallpaper packages are downloaded prepared 50 wallpapers depended on the selected color scheme. Last important change is notification support with portraits with appropriate color scheme too.
All color scheme are applied on-the-fly without restart station, you just select appropriate color scheme and whole WM, wallpapers and other apps are changed. The wallpapers can be swap for appropriate color scheme by super+alt+C forward, super+ctrl+C backward and color scheme table is shown by super+c.

** 80s OneDark Theme
The theme is focused to Atom colors and 80s pastel color schemes. New complex configuration of main panel with many features and additional modifications of conky, xmenu, rofi and alacritty settings.
