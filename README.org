* Introduction
+ *Extensible*
  - API is first-class: discoverable, versioned, documented.
  - MessagePack structured communication enables extensions in any language.
  - Remote plugins run as co-processes, safely and asynchronously.
  - GUIs, IDEs, web browsers can --embed Neovim as an editor or script host.

+ *Usable*
  - Strong defaults
  - Works the same everywhere: one build-type, one command
  - Modern terminal features such as cursor styling, focus events, bracketed paste
  - Built-in terminal emulator

+ *Drop-in Vim*
  - Fully compatible with Vim's editing model and the Vimscript language.
  - Start with :help nvim-from-vim if you already use Vim.

* Nvim Configuration
The configuration is strongly depended on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5d3zOkRrvA][Ben Frain Youtuber]] - Neovim 0.5 â€“ Lua, built in LSP, Treesitter and the best plugins for 2021.

The configuration is very very raw. There is necessary several modifications. There are a lot of bugs with memory etc. It needs time...
